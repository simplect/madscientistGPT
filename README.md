This is largely based on https://github.com/jaymody/picoGPT (Copyright (c) 2023 Jay Mody, MIT license).

I have removed everything that a good programmer would think of, and implemented the Jax recommendations. The code is less dynamic and only works with the GPT-2 124M model.
This all to make it more readable and hackable. *Mad scientist laugh*
